# Portfolio-Site
It was great challenged for me as a non-cs student to build this first portfolio page. at starting i had no idea how to built this.  but once i completed my html and less than half portion of css i got idea to build this.

Problems which i face during project:
1. I could not able to upload images on Deployment site where as it works on VS Code.
    When my project was completed and  ran i couldn't see the image and then later i realized that i had to save the project's HTML and CS file and images all in one    folder and add it to the Github account and then i did it and all After i started seeing photos in the project and on Netifly. You can imagine how much you can be Happy when its done and you do it yourself.
    
2. The Style of image:
I was trying to give different effect to photo's but it didn't work out and then i searched for it on Google and found out the effect and then i added it to my project.
that was hover style.

3. Background color of page:
I tried a lot of color combinations for the background but those colors didn't match the text and then I finally decided  to keep this #655b5b color.
